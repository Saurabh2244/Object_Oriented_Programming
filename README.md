# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Welcome to the **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** repository! This repository contains code examples and implementations that demonstrate various Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++. It serves as a useful reference for beginners and intermediate learners who want to strengthen their understanding of OOP principles.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which can contain data and code that manipulate the data. The four pillars of OOPâ€”**Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**â€”are demonstrated in this repository with various C++ examples.

This repository is designed to help you understand how OOP concepts are implemented in C++, providing code snippets and explanations.

## Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes and creating objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods in a class.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding internal implementation details and exposing only necessary parts.
- **Inheritance**: Reusing existing code through class hierarchies.
- **Polymorphism**: Overloading methods and operators, dynamic method binding (virtual functions).
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Initializing and cleaning up objects.
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing the behavior of operators.
- **Friend Functions**: Granting external functions access to class members.
- **Static Members**: Variables and methods that belong to the class rather than an instance.
- **Virtual Functions**: Enabling polymorphic behavior in derived classes.
- **Function Overriding and Overloading**: Differentiating methods based on parameters or context.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs in this repository, you need the following:

- Basic understanding of C++
- C++ Compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, or any IDE)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saurabh2244/Object_Oriented_Programming.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the cloned folder**:

   ```bash
   cd Object_Oriented_Programming
   ```

3. **Compile and run a specific file**:

   For example, to run the `class_and_object.cpp` file:

   ```bash
   g++ Concepts/class_and_object.cpp -o class_and_object
   ./class_and_object
   ```

## Usage

Each code file corresponds to a specific OOP concept. Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to gain a better understanding of each concept. Detailed comments are provided in the source files to explain how each feature works.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow best practices and add comments to the code.
